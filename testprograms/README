A series of test programs for our code.

A lot of these take/read ridiculous arguments to prevent the optimizer
playing tricks on us. "malloc(42)" usually gets optimized out, for
example, but if the argument is dependent on a command line option then
the optimizer cannot rearrange the code to avoid dynamic allocation.
