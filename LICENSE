Licensing is complicated.

As the copyright holder, I can distribute this under any terms I want.
I distribute this code under the LGPLv3 license.

However, the combined work uses libbfd, which is under the GPL.  Thus
*you* can only redistribute code from this project under the GPL.

In practice, what this means is that you can strip out the ./bfd
subdirectory and then distribute/use modified versions under the terms
of the LGPL.  If you do not want or do not care to strip out ./bfd, you
must utilize the GPL.
